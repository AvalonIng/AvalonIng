ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AvalonIng, Software Engineering Student

The implementation of algorithms in programming, particularly in operations research, is my main area of â€‹â€‹interest. 

Mathematical puzzles and problems have always fascinated me since they combine logic and creativity by encouraging reflection on complex problems. This challenge is, for me, the greatest source of motivation. 
In this regard, software development is a tool for applying key concepts of analysis and algorithmic structure in solving challenges. 

This is a repository of my personnal projects.

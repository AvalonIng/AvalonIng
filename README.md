ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AvalonIng, Software Engineering Student

The implementation of algorithms in programming is my main area of â€‹â€‹interest. 

Mathematical puzzles and problems have always fascinated me since they combine logic and creativity by encouraging reflection on complex problems.
In this regard, software development is a tool for applying key concepts of analysis and algorithmic structure in solving challenges. 

These are my personnal projects (not including all uni projects). I'm just getting started !
